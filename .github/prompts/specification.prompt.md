The goal is to create a basic but beatiful blazor app which does the following: 1) displays ASB entities with active and deadletter(transfer) message counts, from a query against teh ASB emulator's sql backend database. 2) allows the user to read messages from the main or deadletter queue of a listed entity, should default to peek, but have the option for recieve (destructive), the message ApplicationProperties must be visible as well as any Broker properties and the body. 3) Allow the user to send messages to an entity, specifying the message body, broker properties and application properties. 2 and 3 must make use of the standard ASB client package.

The blazor app will be used as part of an Aspire orchestration to allow the user to view and send messages in an Azure Service Bus emulator resource in the same orchestration. The App wil have a reference to the Azure Service Bus emulator resource in order to get its connectionstring, the App will also need the Azure Service Bus emulator resource's child sql server container resource port and sa password, this may have to be manualy entered if we can't get access to them programatically. The Hosting project will define the resource and contain extension methods to make it easy to add the app into an Aspire appHost.

The blazor app should not use bootstrap or any other dependencies but instead use 'vanilla' js and css to create a bootstraplike UI.
It should use a nice monospaced font and a fixed dark theme.
